    <string name="rules">"My name IS Yulya. I am student. One of my hobbies is travelling. I have already visited many parts of Ukraine but my dream is a world tour. As I am student, I do not have enough money for it. The only way out is my favourite TV programme "Around the World". It is a daily programme, so I have an opportunity to visit different countries every day without leaving my house!
Each programme is dedicated to one country. I am fond of foreign languages, English and German, so I watch the programmes about English and German speaking countries with special interest. It is a good chance for me to learn something new about these countries and their citizens. I may see places of historical interest, which I have only read about. I listen to legends, connected with famous people and see the places they were born in."</string>
